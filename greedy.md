# Greedy

### Gas Station
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

For a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). The journey starts with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if it can travel around the circular route once, otherwise return -1.

Example
Given 4 gas stations with gas[i]=[1,1,3,1], and the cost[i]=[2,2,1,1]. The starting gas station's index is 2.

Note  
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

Challenge  
O(n) time and O(1) extra space

##### Analysis
*  Suppose we start from $$i$$, and keep counting summation $$sum$$ =+ $$gas[j] - cost[j]$$, when sum becomes negative at j, we know that the journey cannot continue => i cannot be starting point.
*  What if we start at one of the station from $$i+1$$ to $$j$$ ? Because we already knew that $$i$$ can go to $$k$$, so $$i + k$$ cannot go to $$j$$.
*  In other words, when we have a $$sum$$ is negative, reset our starting point to $$j+1$$, and reset $$sum$$ to 0 in order to remove previous records.
*  Eventually, we will obtain an optimum starting point. We can prove that if the total gas >= total cost, there must be a solution, which is the optimum starting point.

##### Pseudocode
```
sum := 0
total := 0
start_index := 0
for j in 1 .. n
    diff := gas[j] - cost[j]
    sum += diff
    total += diff
    if sum < 0 then
        start_index := j + 1
        sum := 0
if total < 0 then
    return -1
return start_index
```
