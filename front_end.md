# Front End

## HTML
* [`<base>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base): specifies the base URL and base target for all relative URLs in a page.
* [`<pre>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre): text within this element is typically displayed in a non-proportional font exactly as it is laid out in the file.
* `usemap` attr in img tag: the partial URL (starting with '#') of an image map associated with the element.
* [`<map>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map): used with `<area>` elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).


## Design
* 216 Web Safe Color: cross-browser color palette was created to ensure that all computers would display colors correctly.
